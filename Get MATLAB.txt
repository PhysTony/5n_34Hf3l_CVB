As a result of support from MathWorks, a license to install MATLAB for the duration of the course is
available. To get started:

1. If you do not already have a MathWorks account, create one at MathWorks registration page
(https://la.mathworks.com/login?uri=%2Fmwaccount%2F). Be sure to verify your email (check your 
Junk/Spam folders) before moving to step 2.
2. Download MATLAB using the course license(https://la.mathworks.com/licensecenter/classroom/comp-vision1).
If you have difficulty, check that your computer meets the system requirements. Then post a
description of your problem and question in the forums.
