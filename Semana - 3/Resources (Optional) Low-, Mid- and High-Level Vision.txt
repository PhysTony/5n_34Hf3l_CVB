Week 3 Resources: Low, Mid, and High-Level Vision
The following resources were selected to provide an overview of low, mid, and high-level vision.
We would like to acknowledge the authors of the various web articles, videos, and papers for
their insightful discussions and analytics which helped formed the basis for some sections of the
lessons and modules.

Title of Resource: Three Levels
Resource Type: Website
Description: A description of Marr's three distinct levels of analysis of information-processing
